Python has become popular and is being practised across the globe. One of the major reasons for that is, it has an enormous library that can virtually deliver anything under the sun. But there are other reasons behind the <i>insane</i> popularity of the language (which was a product of Guido van Rossum's off-time activity!): 
- Object Oriented
- Interpreted
- Garbage Collected => memory management has been taken below the programmer's active control
- A close link with <i>the mother</i>: the C Language (where it all began!)
- A small set of reserved / key words
- Supports parallel processing to take advanage of the new age multi-core processors
- Frequently downloaded and used libraries (like Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, NumPy, NLTk, Seaborn, PyPlot etc) are optimzed and are continuously getting polished
