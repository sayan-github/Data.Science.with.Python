Python has become popular and is being practised across the globe. One of the major reasons for that is, it has an enormous library that can virtually deliver anything under the sun. But there are other reasons behind the <i>insane</i> popularity of the language (which was a product of Guido van Rossum's off-time activity!): 
- Object Oriented
- Interpreted
- Encourages modular programming with the lavish use of namespaces. 
- Garbage Collected => memory management has been taken below the programmer's active control
- A small set of reserved / key words
- Supports parallel processing to take advanage of the new age multi-core processors
- Frequently downloaded and used libraries (like Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, NumPy, NLTk, Seaborn, PyPlot, keras, OpenCV2 etc) are optimzed and are continuously getting polished
- Once in a while Python constructs give flashes of its <i>the mother</i>, the C Language. In fact Guido's book on extending Python (published by PSF) uses C to explain the nuts and bolts.
